<p>I have been a Philadelphia Eagles fan since 1988. My favorite Eagles player of all time is Randall Cunningham. </p>
       <p>Quarterback <strong>Randall Cunningham</strong><em> #12</em> was one of the first running quarterbacks in the NFL. Cunningham changed the face of the quarterback position as we knew it. He was a groundbreaker and role models to many of today's athletic quarterbacks. A player that was ahead of his time, Cunningham's career <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnoqmTpsSV0'>highlights</a> are unbelievable and incredible to see, even 30 years later. Along with a shutdown defense, led by Pro-Bowler <strong>Reggie White</strong>, Cunningham made the 1988-89 Eagles one of the most exciting teams in the NFL.</p>
       <p>The Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots in the 2018 Super Bowl to win their first Super Bowl in team history 41-33. The winning play of the Super Bowl has been dubbed the <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XmhBaUdges'>'Philly Special'</a>, and will live on in Eagles lore for years to come.
