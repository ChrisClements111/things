       <h1>Boston Red Sox</h1>
      
<p>The Boston Red Sox are one of the oldest francises in Major League Baseball. With a storied history, the Red Sox mystique runs deep throughout the city of Boston and throughout the nation. Red Sox Nation, as it is known is what drew me into becoming a Red Sox fan.</p>
       <p>The Red Sox may best be known for the <em>The Curse of the Bambino</em>. A curse that was brought on by trading their most famous player <a href=http://www.baberuthcentral.com/babesimpact/legends/the-curse-of-the-bambino/enjoy>Babe Ruth</a>. <strong>The Babe</strong> was traded to the New York Yankees in 1914 and triggered an 85 year championship drought.</p>

       <p>The Red Sox won the World Series in 2004. They beat the mighty New York Yankees in the ALCS in an unprecedented comeback. The <em>'Sox'</em> came back from being down 3-0 in the series to defeat the Yankees and move on to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series.</p>
